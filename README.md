## 💡 The Solution
Our solution is divided into different repositories, each focusing on a specific component. This modular approach allows us to maintain flexibility and scalability, enabling users to customize and integrate the solution according to their specific needs and requirements.



### DIDroom Control Room (Dashboard)
The DIDroom Control Room/Dashboard serves as the central hub for managing decentralized identity solutions. It provides a user-friendly interface for configuring settings, monitoring performance, and accessing key functionalities.
   
The core features of the Control Room are: 
 - Creation of credential issuance and verification flows
 - Deployment and provisioning of the DIDroom Microservices
 - Creation of organizations, assigning of privileges to different users
 - The admin panel of the Control Room offers:
    - User management
	- Setup of web-hooks and automation flows
	- Customization of the Control Room menu entries

> [!TIP]
> [GitHub](https://github.com/forkbombeu/signroom)
>
> Deployment on [dashboard.didroom.com](https://dashboard.didroom.com)

### DIDroom Mobile libs (Mobile Zencode)
   A collection of mobile library, *Zencode Mobile* holds all the business logic and contracts shared between the different components of the DIDroom Solution. It serves as a centralized repository for managing and updating the core business logic used across various mobile applications and components.

> [!TIP]
> [GitHub](https://github.com/forkbombeu/mobile_zencode)

### DIDroom microservices
   Those are the technological core of the solution: those components offer cryptographic functions as well as transport protocols. The microservices are completely isolated from the Dashboard, meaning that: 
   - The code is hosted in a separated repo
   - The microservices can run independently from the Dashboard
   - Each microservice has its own secret keys and DID to identify them: those are generated by the microservice at its first provisioning

   DIDroom microservices are generated using No-code-room (NCR) and utilize the Zencode Mobile repository to create three different microservices:
   - **Credential Issuers**: These microservices are compliant with Openid4VCI standards and handle the issuance of credentials.
   - **Authorization Servers**: These microservices implement OAuth2 and work seamlessly with our DID Service for authentication and authorization.
   - **Relying Party**: These microservices are compliant with Openid4VP standards and act as relying parties for authentication and authorization.

> [!TIP]
> [GitHub](https://github.com/forkbombeu/DIDroom_microservices)


### Wallet Holder App
   The Wallet Holder App offers a secure and user-friendly interface for managing decentralized identities and digital credentials. It allows users to store, view, and share their identity information with ease inside a TEE (Trusted execution environment) directly on citizens devices.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deployment from sourcecode

Please follow the "On premise deployment" documentation on our site: [https://forkbombeu.github.io/DIDroom/guides/sysadmin/](https://forkbombeu.github.io/DIDroom/guides/sysadmin/):



[<img src="https://github.com/NGI-TRUSTCHAIN/DidRoom/assets/1547175/a2119dbe-1caa-4bf3-be5c-f2045433dbbd">](https://forkbombeu.github.io/DIDroom/guides/sysadmin/) 




### Containerization with Docker

The deployment strategy for the DidRoom system involves utilizing containerization technology and an on-premise approach, facilitated by Docker. This strategy aims to provide scalability, flexibility, and consistent environments across different stages of deployment.

Containers are employed to encapsulate the DidRoom application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across various environments, from development to production. Docker, a widely-used containerization platform, is employed to create, deploy, and manage containers. This approach enhances deployment efficiency and simplifies environment setup.

Key Aspects of Containerization:
  - `Isolation`: Each component of the DidRoom system, including services and middleware, is encapsulated within separate containers, maintaining isolation and preventing interference between components.
  - `Portability`: Docker containers encapsulate the entire runtime environment, ensuring the application operates consistently regardless of the hosting environment.
  - `Scalability`: The containerized architecture allows for horizontal scaling, enabling the system to accommodate varying levels of workload.

### On-Premise Deployment

The deployment of DidRoom is executed on-premise, which means the system is hosted and managed within the organization's infrastructure. This approach offers control over data privacy, security, and customization, including the concept of "white label" deployment.

Benefits of On-Premise Deployment:

  - `Data Control`: Sensitivity to data privacy and security requirements can be met by maintaining control over data within the organization's environment.
  - `Customization`: The deployment environment can be tailored to meet specific organizational needs, configurations, and even offer white-label deployment for branding purposes.
  - `Performance`: On-premise deployment often offers lower latency and improved performance, particularly for critical and real-time applications.

The combination of containerization using Docker and on-premise deployment ensures a reliable and efficient deployment strategy for DidRoom, enabling seamless management and scalability while adhering to security, branding, and customization requirements.

**`DidRoom User`**: An external actor who engages with the DidRoom system to manage and control their decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and self-sovereign identity (SSI) credentials. The DidRoom user interacts with the system to create, update, and manage their digital identity attributes, as well as to generate and control verifiable credentials.

The DidRoom user is and individual seeking to leverage decentralized identity technologies for secure and verifiable digital interactions. They interact with the DidRoom system to manage their identity-related data and utilize the cryptographic and blockchain capabilities provided by the system.

**`DidRoom Service Provider`** An external actor that utilizes the DidRoom platform to create and deliver services to users. The service provider engages with the DidRoom system to establish secure data contracts with their users, ensuring the authenticity, integrity, and privacy of user data. The service provider may include individuals, organizations, or entities that offer services that require secure identity and data interactions.

Key Characteristics:
- `Service Creation`: The service provider utilizes the DidRoom system to create services that require identity and data verification. These services may involve user interactions, transactions, verifiable claims, or any other form of secure digital activity.

## 📐 Architectural overview

DidRoom's architecture is designed to achieve the following design goals:

### Secure
DidRoom is engineered to protect information and data to ensure access is limited appropriately based on user types and levels. It is designed to thwart attack patterns initiated by malicious actors. The use of Zenroom's cryptographic capabilities and secure communication protocols contributes to data protection.

### Usable
Usability is a primary concern of DidRoom's architecture. The system is designed to enable users to perform tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently. The user interface is carefully crafted to enhance the user experience while adhering to security principles. Signroom, the web-based service, ensures that cryptographic operations are user-friendly and accessible.

### Operable
Operability is ensured by designing DidRoom to be easy to deploy, operate, monitor, and control. The architecture employs established deployment patterns and clear operational interfaces. The integration of Zenswarm as a blockchain oracle solution contributes to the system's ability to seamlessly interact with different blockchains. Also the dashboard will allow to provision new oracle nodes and easily access to information like auditing logs.

### Reliable
DidRoom is engineered to reliably perform specified functions under defined conditions without interruptions or failures. The architecture is designed with fault tolerance and redundancy in mind. The use of Dyne.org's W3C-DID implementation with its built-in explorer enhances the reliability of identity-related operations.
