### Multi-platform, multi-functional Identity/SSI wallet

</div>


---
<br><br>


## üéØ Intro and Goals

DIDroom is an open-source multiplatform and multifunctional Identity DID/SSI wallet.
DIDroom will also have advanced cryptographic and blockchain functions, including signatures, multi-signatures and blockchain interoperability (for Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth, and Planetmint) via Oracles.

### Design goals

**`Secure`** Protect information and data so that persons or other products have only access to an extend appropriate to their types and levels, and to defend against attack patterns by malicious actors

**`Usable`** Enable users to perform their tasks safely, effectively and efficiently while enjoying the experience

**`Operable`** Easy to deploy, operate, monitor and control

**`Reliable`** Perform specified functions under specified conditions without interruptions or failures

### User stories and functional requirements

The user stories in form of text are avaialble [here](https://github.com/forkbombEu/signroom/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%86%E2%80%8D%E2%99%80%EF%B8%8F+User+story%22+sort%3Acreated-asc) they are live and in progress.

In the meantime the user journey are also under development available on [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Z2z4uAFbQY8lnv06bK017z/DidRoom---User-stories?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=dp0BQVHrNWaO47KK-1) to give an example of the outcomes:

## ‚úã Constraints

### Regulatory Constraints
 - DidRoom's architecture is subject to the eIDAS 2.0 regulation, ensuring alignment with the latest identity and electronic signature standards within the European Union.
 - The architecture adheres to "The European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework" (EUDI-ARF, version 1.0.0), a pivotal component of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation.

### Technical Constraints
 - DIDroom is required to support the W3C-DID and W3C-VC standards to ensure compatibility with identity and verifiable credential systems.
 - The cryptographic capabilities of Zenroom will be utilized for various functions, including signatures, hashes, multisignatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.
 - The architecture must support a federated 4-levels W3C-DID method with multiple storage mechanisms, such as filesystems, databases, blockchains, Git, and IPFS.
 - The architecture must accommodate the blockchain interoperability requirements for Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, and Planetmint.

### Organizational Constraints
 - The architecture leverages open-source components developed by the Dyne.org Foundation
 - DIDroom is based on components of the Zenroom ecosystem, including the cryptographic virtual machine "Zenroom" and Dyne.org's W3C-DID implementation.

### Integration Constraints
- Zenswarm, a blockchain oracle technology, will be used for blockchain interoperability and off-chain cryptography. It features a built-in off-chain consensus algorithm and is developed using Zenroom at its core.
- Signroom, a web-based service, will be integrated to enable users to sign documents and objects using W3C-DID identities.

### Compatibility and Security Constraints
- DidRoom must be compatible with modern smartphones and the latest mobile operating systems.
- The wallet's operation must be secure on the client side, ensuring data privacy and protection. All cryptographic operations and sensitive data handling should occur within the secure environment of the user's device.

## üîç Scope and context

**`DidRoom User`**: An external actor who engages with the DidRoom system to manage and control their decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and self-sovereign identity (SSI) credentials. The DidRoom user interacts with the system to create, update, and manage their digital identity attributes, as well as to generate and control verifiable credentials.

The DidRoom user is and individual seeking to leverage decentralized identity technologies for secure and verifiable digital interactions. They interact with the DidRoom system to manage their identity-related data and utilize the cryptographic and blockchain capabilities provided by the system.

**`DidRoom Service Provider`** An external actor that utilizes the DidRoom platform to create and deliver services to users. The service provider engages with the DidRoom system to establish secure data contracts with their users, ensuring the authenticity, integrity, and privacy of user data. The service provider may include individuals, organizations, or entities that offer services that require secure identity and data interactions.

Key Characteristics:
- `Service Creation`: The service provider utilizes the DidRoom system to create services that require identity and data verification. These services may involve user interactions, transactions, verifiable claims, or any other form of secure digital activity.
- `Data Contracts`: The service provider establishes data contracts with their users, outlining the mandatory and optional attributes for the use of the service and the handling of user data. These contracts are secured through the cryptographic capabilities of the DidRoom system.
- `Verifiable Claims`: The service provider leverages the verifiable credentials and cryptographic features of the DidRoom system to issue and verify claims about users. These verifiable claims can be used to attest to the authenticity of user attributes or transactions.
- `Secure Interactions`: The service provider is ensured that interactions with users occur in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The DidRoom system enables secure communication, data sharing, and verification of user identity and claims.
- `Integration with Blockchain Networks`: If required, the service provider can integrate their services with external blockchain networks (such as Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, Planetmint) through the DidRoom system, by using the zenswarm oracles interoperability capabilities.
