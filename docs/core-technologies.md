## üîê Zenroom   
   Zenroom is responsible for all underlying cryptographic operations within the Didroom ecosystem. It provides a secure execution environment for cryptographic operations and smart contracts, ensuring privacy, security, and integrity in digital interactions. Notably, Zenroom runs isomorphically on the web, mobile, and servers across various platforms in a deterministic way.

## üìú Slangroom
   Slangroom enhances the Zencode language of Zenroom by allowing the addition of plugins. These plugins extend the functionality of Zencode by enabling actions that do not necessarily need to be performed within virtual machines. Slangroom's approach is super standard, making it easy to add custom functionalities within the Zencode natural language. Additionally, Slangroom is capable of running over web pages using WebAssembly.

## üõ†Ô∏è No-code-room (NCR)
   No-code-room is a Single Executable Application (SEA) for Linux. It takes a filesystem with .zen (Zencode/Slangroom) contracts and creates API microservices using live-directory routing. NCR seamlessly generates REST services that are auto-documented with OpenAPI. Additionally, it creates small graphic interfaces on the fly, referred to as applets.

## üîó Dyne.org Decentralized Identifiers (DID) Service
   In 2022, Dyne.org implemented a W3C-DID method approved by the W3C governing board and included in the official DID method list. The DID service supports federation and provides tools for the creation, resolution, and management of decentralized identifiers (DIDs). It includes support for ECDSA, EDDSA, Schnorr, Ethereum address, as well as a Dilithium quantum-proof public key.
