Whether you're looking to streamline identity verification processes, enhance data security, or enable secure communication channels, Didroom provides the tools and infrastructure you need.

You can quickly test, plug and deploy by using our service at [beta.signroom.io](https://beta.signroom.io) or install the whole ecosystem on-premise on your infrastructure.


## How It Works

Didroom offers a seamless and intuitive experience for managing decentralized identities and secure communication. Here's how it works:

* **Define services and credentials:** Via the Didroom Control Room, users can define services, credentials, and claims services according to their specific requirements.

* **Generate Openid4VCI microservices:** Users can generate Openid4VCI microservices directly from the bloom using the Control Room, simplifying the process of creating and deploying identity verification services.

* **Plug custom business logic:** Didroom allows users to add custom business logic to their applications, tailoring the functionality to meet their unique needs and requirements.

* **Integrate pre-existing microservices:** Users can seamlessly integrate their microservices into their existing systems or applications, enhancing functionality and interoperability.

* **Deploy and control microservices nodes:** Didroom enables users to deploy and control microservices nodes directly from the Control Room, streamlining the deployment and management process.

* **Enhance your business logic with natural language smart contracts (Zencode):** With Didroom, users can enhance their business logic with natural English smart contracts, enabling advanced automation and decision-making capabilities.
