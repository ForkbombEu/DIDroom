# Join organization

Ideally you'd want to join an organization after you created an account on the wallet. 
Managing users in organization is happening in the [DIDroom Control Room](https://dashboard.didroom.com/), there are multiple ways to do that: 
- You can request to join an organization from *My organizations > Join an organization*
- As organization manager you can invite a user to join, from the organization page, go to *Members > Add member*


# Member of an organization

Once you have joined an organization you will see in your Wallet's home page, the list of the credentials that the organization is offering. Meaning that you can click on the credential's card to request it.
