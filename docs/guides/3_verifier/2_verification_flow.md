# Start a Verification Flow

After you logged in the Verifier, you will be presented with a list **Verification Flows**, you can run. The flows you see depend on the organization(s) you are member of. 

To start a **Verification Flow** just click the one you want to start from the list: a QR code with a session ID should appear in the next page.
