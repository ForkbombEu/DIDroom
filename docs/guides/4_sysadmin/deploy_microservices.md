# Deploy microservices

#### for üõ†Ô∏è System Administrator

## Preparation

- Register a domain name, let's say: _microservices.myapp.domain_

- Setup a linux server, configure SSL and make sure the server is resolved at: https://microservices.myapp.domain/

- Make sure you have all the commands installed, type: _sudo apt install make wget jq git -y_

## Provision and download the Microservices

- Go to https://dashboard.didroom.com and create at leastt an Issuance Flow. During the creation, you will have to create multiple objects, such as templates and microservices setup. 
- Then From the *Microservices* page, click on "Download microservices"
- The Microservices page should look like this:

## Deploy the Microservices

1. Copy the microservices.zip file on the server and unzip it, it should create the folder /DIDroom_microservices (which maybe will be inside /microservices...(

1. type: _cd DIDroom_microservices_

1. copy *.env.example*, once for each microservice to *auth.env*, *iss.env* and *rp.env* and configure:
   - UP_PORT with the local port on which the microservice will be started
   - MS_NAME with the relative path, where the microservice is deployed (e.g. /my_credential_issuer)
   - MS_URL with the root endpoint of the microservice (for example:  https://my.microservices.com/my_credential_issuer)

1. type: _make up_ (this command generates the secret keys for the microservices, and registers a DID for each of them)

From that moment, you should have the microservices (authz_server, credential_issuer and relying_party) configured and running.

**Note**: configuration of the .env is soon to be automatically written by the Dashboard (this is a temp workaround)

## Receive your first credential

- install the wallet on an android phone from here: https://github.com/ForkbombEu/wallet (you can scan the QR code on the github repo),
- create a user on the wallet
- scan the QR code you see in the issuance flow page
- If everything worked well, you should see something like this in the wallet:

[DIDroom Microservices](/solution#didroom-microservices) are the technological core of the solution: those components offer cryptographic functions as well as transport protocols. The microservices are completely isolated from the Dashboard, meaning that:

- The code is hosted in a separated repo
- The microservices can run independently from the Dashboard
- Each microservice has its own secret keys and DID to identify them: those are generated by the microservice at its first provisioning
