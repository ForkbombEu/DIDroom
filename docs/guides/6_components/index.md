**Issuance flow**: TBW

**[Verification flow](./verification.md)**

**Templates**: TBW

**Decentralized Identifier (DID)**: A globally unique, self-sovereign identifier that enables individuals and entities to have control over their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities.

**EUDI-ARF**: Acronym for "The European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework," a technical core of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation that outlines standards for digital identity wallets.

**eIDAS 2.0 Regulation**: The updated version of the eIDAS (electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) regulation that sets standards for electronic identification and trusted services within the European Union.

**Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**: A decentralized identity model that enables individuals to have full control over their digital identity and personal data. SSI allows users to manage and share verifiable credentials without the need for intermediaries.

**Verifiable Credentials (VC)**: Digital attestations that enable the issuance and verification of claims about a subject's identity, attributes, or qualifications.

**Wallet**: In the context of DidRoom, a software application or platform that allows users to manage their digital identities, store cryptographic keys, create and manage DIDs, and interact with blockchain networks and verifiable credentials.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Cryptographic methods that allow a party to prove knowledge of a certain value or statement without revealing the actual value itself. Zero-knowledge proofs enhance privacy and security by demonstrating knowledge without disclosing sensitive information.

**W3C-DID**: Abbreviation for "W3C Decentralized Identifier," a standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for creating, managing, and resolving decentralized identifiers.

**W3C-VC**: Abbreviation for "W3C Verifiable Credentials," a standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for creating and verifying digital credentials in a secure and interoperable manner.

**Zenroom**: A cryptographic virtual machine developed by Dyne.org Foundation, capable of performing various cryptographic operations and supporting blockchain interoperability.

**Zenswarm**: A blockchain oracle technology developed for blockchain interoperability and off-chain cryptography, utilizing Zenroom at its core.
