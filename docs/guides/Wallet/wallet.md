 - Scan a QR code to receive a credential

## Test on the web

The Wallet can also be deployed as a web application, offering most of the app functionalities and ideal for testing and debugging. You can deploy your own instance by following the  [instructions](https://github.com/ForkbombEu/wallet?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) or test our (manually updated) web deployment at [wallet.didroom.com](https://wallet.didroom.com/).

## White-labeling

The Wallet (and Verifier) App are built with white-labeling in mind>

1. The mobile apps take load ALL the UX from [didroom-copmponents](https://github.com/forkbombeu/didroom-components) which is packaged into [NPM 
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@didroom/components) via CI. 
1. The whole deployment of the mobile apps on the Android/iOS stores is done via CI,see for example the Android production deployment [CI script](https://github.com/ForkbombEu/wallet/actions/workflows/publish_on_production.yml).
