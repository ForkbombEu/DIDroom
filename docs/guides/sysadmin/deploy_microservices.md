# Deploy microservices

#### for üõ†Ô∏è System Administrator

## Preparation

- Register a domain name, let's say: _microservices.myapp.domain_

- Setup a linux server, configure SSL and make sure the server is resolved at: https://microservices.myapp.domain/

- Make sure you have all the commands installed, type: _sudo apt install make wget jq git -y_

## Provision and download the Microservices

- Go to https://dashboard.didroom.com and create an issuance flow
- From the issuance flow page, download the microservices.zip file by"Download microservices"
- The issuance flow page should look like this:

![issuance_flow](https://github.com/ForkbombEu/DIDroom/assets/1547175/08725fe0-6d8f-4fae-a043-86400b0a9f83)

## Deploy the Microservices

- Copy the microservices.zip file on the server and unzip it, it should create the folder /DIDroom_microservices (which maybe will be inside /microservices...(

- type: _cd DIDroom_microservices_

- type: _make up_ (this command generates the secret keys for the microservices, and registers a DID for each of them)

From that moment, you should have the microservices (authz_server and credential_issuer) running and configured.

## Receive your first credential

- install the wallet on an android phone from here: https://github.com/ForkbombEu/wallet (you can scan the QR code on the github repo),
- create a user on the wallet
- scan the QR code you see in the issuance flow page
- If everything worked well, you should see something like this in the wallet:

![wallet (Medium)](https://github.com/ForkbombEu/DIDroom/assets/1547175/8bfef092-2423-4cb7-9320-b3d54cbd03cc)

[DIDroom Microservices](/solution#didroom-microservices) are the technological core of the solution: those components offer cryptographic functions as well as transport protocols. The microservices are completely isolated from the Dashboard, meaning that:

- The code is hosted in a separated repo
- The microservices can run independently from the Dashboard
- Each microservice has its own secret keys and DID to identify them: those are generated by the microservice at its first provisioning
