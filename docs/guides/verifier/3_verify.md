# Verification: Success or Failure

The **Verification Flow** is active for some time, during this time a user holding a Wallet can scan the QR Code generated by the Verifier. Scanning the QR will trigger the credential presentation to the **Reying Party** (an external microservice that verifies the credential). 

The result can be: 
- Success: if the Relying Party returns a success result before the expiration
- Failure: if the Relying Party returns a failure or if nothing happens before the expiration
