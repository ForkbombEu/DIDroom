# Verifier App 

The [Verifier App ](https://github.com/ForkbombEu/verifier) is an Android/iOS mobile app whose purpose is to start a **Verification Flow**. 

The Verifer App requires the user to have created an account (and ideally be part of an organization), so an account needs to be created on the [DIDroom Control Room](https://dashboard.didroom.com/) or in the Wallet.
