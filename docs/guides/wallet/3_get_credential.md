# Request a credential 

A credential is a cryptographic object, containing a set of claims and a signature from a trusted issuer. 

After you have created an account and logged in, you can request a credential in multiple ways: 
- From the Wallet's home page: you can request all the credentials that have been created as "public" in the [DIDroom Control Room](https://dashboard.didroom.com/).
- By scanning a QR-Code: you can re-quest a credential. The Wallet is compatible with the [OpenID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) standard, so you should be able to request (and receive) credentials also from Credential Issuers which are setup or connected to [DIDroom](https://dashboard.didroom.com/).

# Your credentials

You can browse the credentials you received in the *Wallet* page of the Wallet (D'Oh!), they will be listed as cards and show you the issuer that produced them, their expiry and descriptions.
