## How It Works

Didroom offers a seamless and intuitive experience for managing decentralized identities and secure communication. Here's how it works:

- **Define services and credentials:** Via the Didroom Control Room, users can define services, credentials, and claims services according to their specific requirements.

- **Generate Openid4VCI microservices:** Users can generate Openid4VCI microservices directly from the bloom using the Control Room, simplifying the process of creating and deploying identity verification services.

- **Plug custom business logic:** Didroom allows users to add custom business logic to their applications, tailoring the functionality to meet their unique needs and requirements.

- **Integrate pre-existing microservices:** Users can seamlessly integrate their microservices into their existing systems or applications, enhancing functionality and interoperability.

- **Deploy and control microservices nodes:** Didroom enables users to deploy and control microservices nodes directly from the Control Room, streamlining the deployment and management process.

- **Enhance your business logic with natural language smart contracts (Zencode):** With Didroom, users can enhance their business logic with natural English smart contracts, enabling advanced automation and decision-making capabilities.

- **Whitelabel wallet and verifier apps:** To interact with your services individuals need a wallet app that we provide for whitelabeling. Same a verifier app for indivisuals that want to verify credentials.

## Features

- **Compliance:** Didroom is compliant with industry standards and regulations, including EUDI-ARF, ensuring adherence to data protection laws and regulations.
- **End-to-End encryption:** Secure communication is facilitated through end-to-end encryption, ensuring that messages and data remain private and confidential.
- **Decentralized identity management:** Didroom enables users to create, control, and manage their digital identities in a decentralized manner, eliminating reliance on central authorities.
- **Customizable and extensible:** Didroom is highly customizable and extensible, allowing organizations to tailor the platform to their specific needs and integrate with existing systems seamlessly.

## Integration and flexibility

Didroom is designed to be seamlessly integrated into third-party solutions and environments. Its modular architecture allows for easy integration with existing microservices or other identity management systems. Whether you need to use Didroom as a standalone solution or integrate it into your existing infrastructure, Didroom provides the flexibility and adaptability you need.
