# ðŸŽ® Quickstart

[DIDroom Microservices](/solution#didroom-microservices) are the technological core of the solution: those components offer cryptographic functions as well as transport protocols. The microservices are completely isolated from the Dashboard, meaning that: 
- The code is hosted in a separated repo
- The microservices can run independently from the Dashboard
- Each microservice has its own secret keys and DID to identify them: those are generated by the microservice at its first provisioning
