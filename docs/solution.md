# ðŸ’¡ The Solution

Our solution is divided into different repositories, each focusing on a specific component. This modular approach allows us to maintain flexibility and scalability, enabling users to customize and integrate the solution according to their specific needs and requirements.

## DIDroom Dashboard (Dashboard)

The DIDroom Dashboard/Dashboard serves as the central hub for managing decentralized identity solutions. It provides a user-friendly interface for configuring settings, monitoring performance, and accessing key functionalities.

The core features of the Control Room are:

- Creation of credential issuance and verification flows
- Deployment and provisioning of the DIDroom Microservices
- Creation of organizations, assigning of privileges to different users
- The admin panel of the Control Room offers:
  - User management
  - Setup of web-hooks and automation flows
  - Customization of the Control Room menu entries

## DIDroom Mobile libs (Mobile Zencode)

A collection of mobile library, _Zencode Mobile_ holds all the business logic and contracts shared between the different components of the DIDroom Solution. It serves as a centralized repository for managing and updating the core business logic used across various mobile applications and components.

## DIDroom microservices

Those are the technological core of the solution: those components offer cryptographic functions as well as transport protocols. The microservices are completely isolated from the Dashboard, meaning that:

- The code is hosted in a separated repo
- The microservices can run independently from the Dashboard
- Each microservice has its own secret keys and DID to identify them: those are generated by the microservice at its first provisioning

DIDroom microservices are generated using No-code-room (NCR) and utilize the Zencode Mobile repository to create three different microservices:

- **Credential Issuers**: These microservices are compliant with Openid4VCI standards and handle the issuance of credentials.
- **Authorization Servers**: These microservices implement OAuth2 and work seamlessly with our DID Service for authentication and authorization.
- **Relying Party**: These microservices are compliant with Openid4VP standards and act as relying parties for authentication and authorization.
