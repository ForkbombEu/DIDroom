# ðŸ’¡ The Solution
Our solution is divided into different repositories, each focusing on a specific component. This modular approach allows us to maintain flexibility and scalability, enabling users to customize and integrate the solution according to their specific needs and requirements.

## Mobile Zencode
   Zencode Mobile holds all the business logic and contracts shared between the different components of the DiDRoom Solution. It serves as a centralized repository for managing and updating the core business logic used across various mobile applications and components.

## Didroom microservices
   Didroom microservices are generated using No-code-room (NCR) and utilize the Zencode Mobile repository to create three different microservices:
   - **Credential Issuers**: These microservices are compliant with Openid4VCI standards and handle the issuance of credentials.
   - **Authorization Server**: These microservices implement OAuth2 and work seamlessly with our DID Service for authentication and authorization.
   - **Relying Party**: These microservices are compliant with Openid4VP standards and act as relying parties for authentication and authorization.
